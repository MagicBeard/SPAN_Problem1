# SPAN_Problem1
The solution to the first code challenge as part of the SPAN interview process.

How to run the code:

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Make sure the input file is in the same directory as the python script file locally
3. Ensure python3 is installed with the pandas library
4. In the consol or terminal, you can type 'python' followed by a space and then the exact path location of the python script
5. The output file will be saved in the same directory as the python script

Additional notes:

The script was developed in Jupyter notebooks and then transfered to a standard pythoin file, the Jupyter notebook file is included in the repository.
